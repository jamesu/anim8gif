## What is it?

Ever visited a web page full of crazy animated GIFs, but found bookmarking them on your iPhone/iPad to be a pain?

Well be let down no more, as Anim8gif allows you to bookmark and view any GIF located on any website. Simply enter the URL, and Anim8gif will allow you to select and animate any one of the GIFs located on your favourite websites in full screen.

In addition, for browsing on the go, Anim8gif includes a Bookmarklet to open up GIFs straight from Safari.

Features:

* Animates any animated GIF from any website in full screen
* Bookmark GIFs and websites for later viewing

## Sounds great, how do i install it?

You will need to build the "webplay" project and install it on your target device.

Have fun!
